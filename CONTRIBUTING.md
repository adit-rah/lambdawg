# Contributing to Lambdawg

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lambdawg!  
This is an early-stage experimental language — contributions of all kinds are welcome: design discussions, syntax proposals, compiler work, libraries, documentation.

## Ground Rules

1. **Respect the Manifesto**  
   All proposals should align with the [Manifesto](./MANIFESTO.md). If a suggestion contradicts it, be explicit about why.

2. **Clarity First**  
   Code, documentation, and discussion should favor clarity over cleverness. Lambdawg is about making hard things simpler, not making simple things hard.

3. **Open Design**  
   Language design discussions should happen openly. Please use issues or discussion threads — no private forks with secret features.

4. **Incremental Evolution**  
   Favor iterative improvement over massive changes. Lambdawg should evolve step by step, with each step documented.

## How to Contribute

- **Design & Discussion**: Open an issue with `[design]` in the title.  
- **Documentation**: Help refine the manifesto, write examples, or clarify syntax.  
- **Implementation**: Contributions to the compiler or runtime are welcome once the reference implementation begins.

## Development Setup

The reference compiler is not yet implemented. Once it is, setup instructions will be documented here. For now, contributions are focused on **language design**.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and welcoming. Lambdawg is a collaborative experiment, not a competition.
